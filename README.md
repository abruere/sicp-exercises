# SICP - Solutions

The [book is freely available](https://sicpebook.wordpress.com/) thanks to the authors and is very valuable for self-study of Computer Science.

Iâ€™m also grateful for the info provided by [https://teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com), pointing to high-quality CS material.

## Scheme (Lisp) implementation

[MIT/Scheme 10.1.10](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) implementation is used for these exercises.

[Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/scheme) was also very useful (using the BiwaScheme under the hood, by Yutaka HARA).
